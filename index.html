                <h2>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h2>
                <h3>Custom / Special Orders:</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to the specificity of some of the products offered by Rhino Adventure Gear any special-order / custom items may only be canceled and or refunded if the item has not yet shipped from the manufacturer. If the items have left the manufacture's facility, the items will no longer be refundable.
                </p>
                <h3>Manufacturer’s warranties:</h3>
                <p>
                    We do not offer any extensions on manufacturer’s warranties at this time. If you have any difficulties with a product, we are happy to help you reach the appropriate contacts at the manufacturer. We would genuinely like to help with this, as it also helps us keep track of customer satisfaction with the products we offer from various vendors.
                </p>
                <h3>Shipping Information (See Return Policy for more information):</h3>
                <p>
                    We currently ship only to US addresses serviceable by UPS. This means we cannot ship to P.O. boxes (APO or FPO).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please be advised that many items we carry exceed the 150lb standard shipping limit that is imposed by USPS, FedEx, and UPS. This means we may need to use Freight Shipping to send your items, and unfortunately freight shipping adds on fees if they need to deliver to a residential address. This is just a sad reality of shipping large, heavy (awesome) equipment. Please bear in mind the shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to mitigate the risk of credit card fraud to both Rhino Adventure Gear and our customers, we do not allow you to modify your shipping address after the order has been placed. If we suspect a fraudulent transaction, we may contact you and conduct a brief security check. Please do not feel offended by this should it occur, we do it to insure that your accounts have not been compromised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the unlikely event that your order is damaged during shipment, we will help you file a claim with the shipping company. After the order has left our warehouse, we are not responsible for any damages incurred and all claims of damages must be made directly with the shipping company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    **Therefore we strongly suggest that you take the time to carefully inspect your purchase for damages BEFORE SIGNING the delivery paperwork.**
                </p>
